{file, hosts, "/etc/hosts"}.

%% Resolver parameters can also be seeded from the following files.
%{file, resolv, "/etc/resolv.conf"}.
%{file, nsswitch, "/etc/nsswitch.conf"}.

%% Lookup sequence:
%%
%%  file -> check hosts table (contents of "/etc/hosts" by default)
%%  dns  -> use Erlang's DNS resolver
%%
%% If you don't want to use Erlang's DNS resolver, specify "native" instead.
{lookup, [file, dns]}.
